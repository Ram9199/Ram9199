**Repo Name:**  `enterprise-rag-kg`

**3 Bullet Points:**

* **Value:** This repo provides a complete, scalable, and secure RAG solution leveraging the power of vector databases (pgvector or Qdrant) for semantic search and a knowledge graph for enhanced context and relationship understanding. It includes robust access control mechanisms (e.g., role-based access, data encryption) crucial for enterprise deployment,  unlike many open-source RAG implementations.  It offers a modular design allowing easy integration with existing enterprise systems and data sources.

* **Stack:**
    * **Vector Database:** pgvector (default) or Qdrant (configurable) for efficient similarity search.
    * **Knowledge Graph Database:** Neo4j (Community Edition) for storing and querying relationships between knowledge pieces.  Alternative graph DBs could be supported.
    * **Embeddings Model:** Sentence Transformers (Hugging Face).  Easily swappable for other embedding models.
    * **API Server:** FastAPI (Python) for a clean and efficient API interface.
    * **Access Control:**  Auth0 (or similar) integration for user authentication and authorization.  Fine-grained access control at the document/knowledge graph level.
    * **Document Processing:**  Libraries for PDF/text extraction and cleaning.


* **Quickstart:**  The repo includes a Docker Compose setup for easy local development and testing. A pre-populated knowledge graph (sample data) and a set of documents are provided. The quickstart guide walks users through:
    1.  Setting up the environment (Docker Compose).
    2.  Loading sample data into the Vector DB and Knowledge Graph.
    3.  Making queries via the FastAPI endpoint (example curl commands and a simple Python client are provided).
    4.  Testing the access control mechanisms by creating users with different roles.


This design prioritizes ease of use and extensibility while addressing the security and scalability concerns typical in enterprise environments.  The modular design allows users to swap components based on their specific needs and infrastructure.</div>
