**Value Proposition:**

* **Scalable and performant:** Leverages the strengths of pgvector (for smaller to medium-sized datasets) and Qdrant (for large-scale datasets) to provide robust vector search capabilities for RAG applications.  Handles both structured and unstructured data seamlessly, allowing for hybrid knowledge bases.  Includes features for managing access control and data versioning crucial for enterprise deployments.
* **Modular and extensible:** Designed with a plugin architecture to allow easy integration with various LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Llama 2, etc.), embedding models (SentenceTransformers, etc.), and data sources (databases, cloud storage).  This flexibility enables adaptation to specific enterprise needs and evolving technologies.
* **Simplified deployment and management:** Offers pre-built Docker images and comprehensive documentation for easy setup and operation, reducing the barrier to entry for enterprise adoption. Includes monitoring and logging capabilities for enhanced operational visibility and troubleshooting.

**Technology Stack:**

* **Vector Databases:** pgvector (PostgreSQL extension) &amp; Qdrant (as a scalable alternative for larger datasets).  Automatic switching based on dataset size is a target feature.
* **LLMs/Embeddings:**  Abstraction layer supporting multiple LLMs and embedding models via plugins.  Defaults to SentenceTransformers for embeddings.
* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) for API endpoints.
* **Data Storage:**  PostgreSQL (for metadata and structured data), potentially integrations with cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) for unstructured data.
* **Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes (optional, for larger deployments).

**Quickstart:**

* **Clone the repo:** `git clone https://github.com/&lt;your_github&gt;/VectorHub-Enterprise` (replace with actual repo URL).
* **Docker Compose:**  Run the provided `docker-compose.yml` to spin up the entire stack (PostgreSQL, pgvector/Qdrant, FastAPI backend).
* **Data Ingestion:** Use the provided scripts or API to ingest your data (both structured and unstructured).  The system automatically determines which vector database to use.  Example included for loading data from CSV files.  Then, query the system via the provided API endpoints.  Detailed tutorials and examples provided in the repository.</div>
