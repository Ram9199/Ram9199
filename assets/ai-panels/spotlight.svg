**Value Proposition:**  A robust, scalable, and customizable open-source RAG framework leveraging the power of pgvector and Qdrant for vector databases, prioritizing security, auditability, and enterprise-grade features missing in simpler solutions.  This aims to bridge the gap between research-focused RAG implementations and the needs of production environments.

* **Enhanced Security &amp; Auditability:**  Integrates with enterprise authentication systems (e.g., LDAP, OAuth), provides fine-grained access control lists (ACLs) for documents and queries, and logs all interactions for auditing purposes.
* **Scalability &amp; Performance:** Uses pgvector for structured data and Qdrant for high-dimensional embeddings, offering a hybrid approach that balances the strengths of both. This allows efficient scaling to handle large document collections and high query loads.
* **Extensibility &amp; Customization:**  Modular design allows easy integration with various LLMs (via API wrappers), embedding models, and document loaders, enabling users to tailor the system to their specific needs and data formats.


**Stack:**

* **Vector Databases:** pgvector (for structured data), Qdrant (for unstructured data and high-dimensional vectors)
* **LLMs:**  Abstraction layer to support multiple LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face Inference API).  Initial implementation could focus on OpenAI's models.
* **Document Loaders:** Support for various document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML) with configurable preprocessing pipelines.
* **Authentication &amp; Authorization:**  Integration with industry-standard authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0, LDAP).
* **API:**  RESTful API for interacting with the RAG system.
* **Deployment:**  Docker containers for easy deployment on various platforms (Kubernetes, local machines).


**Quickstart:**

* **Step 1: Setup:** Clone the repo, install dependencies (using `pip install -r requirements.txt`), and configure database connections.
* **Step 2:  Ingestion:** Upload your documents using the provided document loaders.  The system will automatically generate embeddings and store them in the chosen vector database.  Configuration options allow specifying which database to use for different types of data.
* **Step 3: Query:** Use the REST API or a provided client library to send queries. The system will retrieve relevant documents and use the LLM to generate a comprehensive answer.

This structure provides a clear path for users to quickly set up and start using VectorHub Enterprise, while also showcasing the flexibility and advanced features that distinguish it from simpler RAG solutions.</div>
